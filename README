Ping Ya

Titanium Studio based "I am here", but called Ping Ya, IOS app for quickly (like 3 actions) sending your location to a friend. There are no social aspects to this, just quick and dirty "Ping". Future versions will have the ability to predesignate up to 3 emergency contacts for a two-action send.
